# sortVisualisedJava
A simple visualization of sorting algorithms


For now it is only implemented with insert sort, more will be added at a later date

To run this, simply run "Start" and hit the button for the corresponding algorithm

Program still has some bugs, so if it crashes, just try to rerun it. Will fix at a later date
